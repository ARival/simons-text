      "prompt": "Generate 10 Dialogs from a wiseman who is very knowledgeable about the crystals in this world, though he only really has information about the white one. He's seen the curse slowly taking over the town, and has heard of the belmont family, and appreciates their help, but is resentful due to the Belmonts indirectly unleashing the curse upon the land via their actions. Alternate between talking about needing to buy a white crystal in this town, how the white crystal helps see things that are unseen normally, the state of the country after the curse has come, how old he is, how you are not welcome here, or anything related to these subjects."
